    "In order to work remotely with python we will use a jupyter notebook server on the NIH HPC systems. This allows us to keep track of the commands we enter in a notebook. The notebook server also allows us to edit text, run terminals, and conveniently upload and download files with a graphical interface. In addition we could easily switch this setup to work with  R, Julia, or [many other](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) programming languages using the same interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide a consistent environment for all students we will run the jupyter notebook server from within a [singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov) container. Container technologies (Docker and singularity) allow us to isolate a software stack from the host operating system. It means that using the same container we can rerun our analysis on most operating systems, and computers. There are limits to this portability which you will learn about during the course but overall containers are a very effective means of rapidly sharing a distinct environment in which to run an analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A universal solution for a course setup to run the required software - for employees within NIH, as well as those with guest accounts from outside - is to run the aforementioned singularity container on a [biowulf](https://hpc.nih.gov/systems/) computing node. It utilizes the superb resources available from the NIH HPC as well as avoiding the problems of attempting to work reproducibly across many personal computers with varying degrees of installation privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are working remotely we can be vulnerable to internet connectivity issues. To reduce the effect of drops in connectivity we will use [tmux](http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) with its session management, which allows us to maintain a persistent shell session on the compute node independent of an internet connection. Without this software, we would lose our work each time our internet connectivity dropped. Once the tmux session is setup, we will only need to reconnect to it if we need to change something with  our launched singularity container/jupyter notebook server (hopefully this won't happen). If connective does drop, we simply need to reopen a connection (with the appropriate port forwarding to our compute node).\n",
